# Employee-Management-System
This repository consists of Java Program for Employee Management System. In this repository I have created a TUI program for Employee Management System which consists of 5 different operation.<br>
(1) Adding Employee<br>  (2) Removing Employee<br> (3) Updating Employee<br>  (4) Viewing details of Employee<br>  (5) See salary statistics of employees<br>

The EmployeeFiles folder contains ten examples of employee data, and newly added employees are added to the folder in the "employee ID.txt" format.<br>
The Program is completely based on OOPs concept.
